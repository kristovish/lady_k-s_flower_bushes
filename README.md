//Flower Bushes
-- Description

The original idea for the "flower_bushes" mod was created by LadyK in 2020. In 2023, kristovish took this idea and incorporated it into the Moonlight falls server.

All textures were designed by LadyK and the code was written by kristovish.

The mod features 15 different types of flower bushes that are randomly generated on default soils. However, each sapling can only thrive (grow) on certain types of soil. It is up to the player to discover which saplings grow in which soils. These flowers also give dyes and with the "hedges" mod installed, they can be converted into beautiful hedges.

-- Things to do:
compatibility with Ethereal,Natural Biomes or Australia mod soils.
Flowerpot mod compatibility.
more uses for flowers


-- Depends
default
dyes?
hedges?
ethereal?
